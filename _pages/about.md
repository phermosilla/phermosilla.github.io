I am Assistant Professor in AI for Visual Computing at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/), at TU Wien, Austria. 
Before joining TU Wien, I did my PostDoc at the Viscom group headed by [Prof. Timo Ropinski](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/mi/institut/mitarbeiter/timo-ropinski/) at Ulm University while working in close collaboration with [Prof. Tobias Ritschel](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri/) from University College London.
I obtained my PhD at the Polytechnical University of Catalonia, under the supervision of [Prof. Pere-Pau Vazquez](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~ppau/) and [Prof. Alvar Vinacua](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~alvar/).

My research is focused on developing machine learning technologies for 3D and unstructured data, with a special interest in `point clouds`, `graphs`, and `implicit representations`.
During my research, I applied these technologies to solve different problems in the fields of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Bioinformatics.
