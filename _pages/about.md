I am Post-Doctoral researcher at the Viscom group headed by [Prof. Timo Ropinski](https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/mi/institut/mitarbeiter/timo-ropinski/) at Ulm University and working in close collaboration with [Prof. Tobias Ritschel](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucactri/) from University College London.
My research is focused on developing machine learning technologies for 3D and unstructured data, with special interest on `point clouds`, `graphs`, and `implicit representations`.
During my research, I applied these technologies to solve different problems on the fields of Compuer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Bioinformatics.

Before joining Ulm Universtiy, I obtained my PhD at Polytechnical University of Catalonia, under the supervision of [Prof. Pere-Pau Vazquez](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~ppau/) and [Prof. Alvar Vinacua](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~alvar/) on the topic of Computer Graphics and Visualization algorithms for Molecular Dynamics Simulations analysis.
